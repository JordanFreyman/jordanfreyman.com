        <h1>Project 5 - Distributed Systems Monitoring</h1>
        <p>For my Parallel & Distributed Computing class, I worked on making a Flask-based web application for real-time and historical monitoring 
            of system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, and network) across a distributed server cluster. It includes user authentication with role-based 
            access control (RBAC), Netdata API integration, automated metric logging, visual data dashboards, and security hardening using Lynis audits and Mozilla Observatory. I used
            the IP addresses of several other groupmates to test the data collection, which is pictured below. The project involved coding in HTML, JavaScript, and Python.
