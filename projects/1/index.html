        <h1>Project 1 - Meal Planning Application</h1>
        <p>This application is a group project I developed with several peers for a Python Programming class in Fall 2024.
            It operates on imports of CSV files containing various ingredients and nutritional facts, in addition to JSON files
            containing different dietary preferences to follow (examples of both are included in the repository). With the provided
            information, the app has back-end programming using an algorithm I made to recommend a variety of recipes to the user following
            the provided ingredients and preferences. The front-end portion of the app allows the user to choose their diet (e.g., vegetarian, keto)
            and to add/remove which ingredients are currently in their pantry. Once the user chooses to generate a meal plan, the interface will show
            several recipe recommendations and ideas for each day of the week. It will also generate a bar graph, implemented using matplotlib, that
            displays the total number of calories and macronutrients per day, calculated using the recipes and ingredient samples of each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating the algorithm was definitely the most challenging part of this project. Ensuring that the dietary preferences were met, the 
            proper ingredients were being utilized, and the daily calorie count was not exceeded by much (excluding leeway) while no repeats of recipes
            were generated within the same day was a lot for me to do! Regardless, the project was completed in due time. Feel free to take a look
            at the demo :)
