        <h1>Project 2 - Point-and-Click Game</h1>
        <p>A passion project game I've been developing since November 2024, mostly by myself. It's a simple life simulator game that involves character creation,
            mini-games, a purchasing and collecting system, and managing character statistics. This started out as a solely text-based game that I
            worked on recreationally, where I used Python and SQLite3 to create characters, save/load the game, travel to different spots on the map,
            purchase randomized meals, and deleting/editing existing characters. There were more ambitious plans in mind with the development of
            this game on my free time, but those were temporarily put on hold when I began porting the existing version to Godot, an open-source 
            third-party game engine that allowed me to start developing a GUI before the game became too advanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I began using Godot for the project, I used it as my Software Engineering Capstone Project and started working with several others
            in a group to develop the game. While I've still done most of the work behind programming and composition, I've had help from my peers
            with creating assets and assembling the interactive menu. So far, only the character creator and a simple map are completed. As we get further
            into the development process, I'll periodically update this page to show what new changes we've made!
