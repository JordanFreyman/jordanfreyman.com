        <h1>Project 3 - Wildlife Conservation Using Unsupervised Clustering</h1>
        <p>This was a research venture for a semester-long project of my Data Mining class. I gave a presentation showing the research
            I conducted using unsupervised clustering for image analysis of camera trap images of wildlife. My goal was to compare several different
            CNN models based on which could detect wildlife from a massive dataset of images, a majority of which didn't contain any wildlife. 
            The presentation discusses the benefits and drawbacks of using unsupervised clustering compared to supervised, as well as the process
            of using my dataset and the models I chose. You may find the results and analysis obtained from the experience in my presentation below.
