        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Jordan Freyman, a recent graduate from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (May 2025). I'm an aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in both individual and collaborative development, and a growing focus on writing clean, well-documented, and scalable code.</p>
        <p>I've worked on a wide range of projects across web development, data mining, game design, database systems, full-stack application dev, and server administration, as well as practicing Agile methodologies with designing flow charts and utilizing iterative development. My favorite programming language is Pythonâ€”it's the first I learned and still the one I use most for its versatility and simplicity. I'm also experienced with C, C++, C#, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and tools like SQLite and JSON. I'm comfortable working in Linux environments, and have hands-on experience developing extensively in Godot and Unity.</p>
        <p>Outside of tech, I'm very passionate about 2D art, and I love exploring my capabilities of blending creativity with code and design. I spend my downtime sketching, learning about old tech, playing Dungeons & Dragons, hiking, or relaxing with a good book.</p>
